# Project Name: SkyStay Resorts Website Redesign 

**One-Line Summary:** 
This project involved modernizing and fully redesigning the SkyStay Resorts website to deliver 
a better mobile experience, stronger user engagement, and improved booking conversions. 

**Problem:** 
When I began working with the client, their existing website had several critical challenges. The 
design was outdated, the site was not responsive across devices, and pages took too long to 
load. Navigation was also confusing, making it harder for visitors to quickly find room details, 
amenities, or booking information. These factors particularly affected mobile users, who today 
form the majority of travel-related traffic. As a result, the site had a high bounce rate, low user 
engagement, and fewer booking inquiries. The business needed a fresh, modern, 
performance-focused website that could support better user experience and conversion rates.

**Target Users:** 
The primary audience for this website consisted of travelers researching resort stays online, 
especially mobile and tablet users who often make booking decisions on-the-go. The site 
therefore needed to accommodate users scanning information quickly, exploring amenities, 
browsing images, and accessing booking options effortlessly. 

**My Role:** 
I led the complete redesign and redevelopment from end to end. My responsibilities covered 
user research, understanding business goals, planning the new information architecture, 
redesigning the UI/UX, implementing the responsive layouts, optimizing performance, 
restructuring content, and managing communication with the client throughout the project. This 
included multiple rounds of feedback and revisions to align both the aesthetic and business 
direction of the new website. 

**Tech Stack:** 

- **WordPress** – Selected for scalability, faster development, and easy post-launch content updates for the client.

- **Elementor Page Builder** – Used for flexible layout control and faster UI/UX design iteration.

- **Custom CSS** – Applied for precise responsive breakpoints, refined layout behavior, and final visual polishing.

- **Lazy Loading Plugins** (e.g., *a3 Lazy Load*) – Implemented to improve loading speed and reduce initial render time.

- **Image Optimization Tools** – Used to compress large media files and enhance overall page performance.


**Core Features:** 
The finished product included several major improvements: 

1. Fully responsive layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop, ensuring consistent usability 
across devices. 
2. A modern UI with improved visual hierarchy, cleaner section layouts, better spacing, and 
consistent branding. 
3. Faster load times achieved through asset compression, lazy loading, and code 
optimizations. 
4. Simplified navigation and site structure that made key pages like rooms, amenities, 
gallery, and booking information easier to discover.

**Main Challenge:** 
The biggest technical challenge was ensuring the site looked visually polished and performed 
smoothly across a wide range of devices and screen resolutions. This required fine-tuned 
responsiveness without sacrificing load time or layout consistency. 

**How I Solved It:** 
To address this, I adopted a mobile-first approach, designing smaller screens first and scaling 
up to larger devices. I reworked responsive breakpoints manually instead of relying only on 
defaults, which allowed tighter control over layout adjustments. I also used browser developer 
tools along with real-device testing across iPhone, Android, and tablet screens to catch 
inconsistencies early. Additionally, I optimized how assets were loaded by prioritizing 
above-the-fold content, deferring less important scripts, and compressing images. These 
decisions collectively ensured seamless performance and a stable design across different 
screen types. 

**Impact / Results:** 
After the new site was deployed, we saw immediate and measurable improvements. Mobile 
bounce rate dropped significantly, user session duration increased, and visitors explored more 
pages per session. Within just a few weeks, booking inquiries increased through the improved 
user experience. Additionally, the modernized visual identity helped elevate the resort’s online 
perception, which the client confirmed through positive customer feedback. 

**What I Learned:** 
This project strengthened several skills. It reinforced the importance of building UX-focused, 
data-driven websites that not only look good but also support measurable business results. I 
gained deeper experience balancing design quality with performance constraints, handling real 
client communication cycles, managing expectations, and making decisions that directly affect 
engagement and conversion metrics.
